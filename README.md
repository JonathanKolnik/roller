## Viewing Results

This is every use of color in your sketch file grouped by hex value. From here you can dive into the use of any color in border, fill, or text. 

Roller designates a color use in two ways, Trend or Error.

### Trend
If you haven't put in any colors in your settings then everything is treated as a trend.

### Error
If you have colors in your settings, than the colors that do NOT match will be treated as errors.

If you have colors in your settings, than the colors that match will be treated as trends, so you can inspect if these colors are being used as expected. 

Click any of the suggestions to replace that specific property, whether it be fill, border, or text color.

### Trend Data
Roller provides insights about how this specific color is used within your file.

It can give the breakdown by property

## Re-Linting 

Auto linting is coming very soon!

In the mean time, any time you select a layer from the plugin, that layer will be re linted.

To re lint the entire file for new layers and changes you made outside of the plugin in - please click the "Lint File" button.

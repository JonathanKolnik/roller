# Introducing Roller by Toybox
Roller is the first Linter for Designers. It works just like spell-check but within your Sketch files - helping you and your team identify design inconsistencies and suggesting edits while you work.

Download the zip to get started, view the documentation below, or visit our site - www.toyboxsystems.com/roller - to learn more :)

## Adding your color palette (optional)
If you have a list of colors you would like to lint against - you can add them in the settings panel.

From the homepage, click the gear icon in the top right corner.

Click "Add New Color."

Enter the color name and hex value (remember to add a '#' before every hex value). Rinse and repeat.

Click "Save" when you are finished.

## Ready to Lint
To get started, click the "Lint My File" button.

Roller will start scanning the colors within every page of your Sketch file. This may take a little longer if your file has thousands of layers :)

## Viewing Results
Once Roller has finished linting, you will see a list of every use of color in your sketch file - grouped by hex value.

Roller designates a color in two ways, Trend or Error.

### Trend
If you haven't put in any colors in your settings then everything is treated and will be displayed a Trend.

### Error
If you have added colors within your settings - then the colors present within your Sketch file that do NOT match those (non-compliant) will be treated as errors.

## Detail view
From the list view, you can click into any color to view it's details, suggestions, and stats.

### Navigating Layers
You can view each occurrence of a color within your sketch file by paging through them with the right and left arrows. This will select and zoom to that specific layer.

### Suggestions
If there is an error, Roller suggests the closest colors (from your Settings) to that error.

![enter image description here](http://toybox-public.s3.amazonaws.com/Suggestions.png)

Click the desired suggestion to replace the layer's specific color - whether it be fill, border, or text color.

Colors being used within your Sketch file that are compliant with those added to your Settings are treated as trends. You can still inspect these colors to view their stats and see if they are being used as expected. 

### Trend Data
Roller provides insights about how any specific color is used within your file.

It can give the breakdown by property

It can also show what other colors are used for that respective property (i.e. border, fill, text)

## Re-Linting 
Auto linting is coming very soon!

In the meantime, when you click into a specific color from the list view, that layer will be re-linted.

To re-lint the entire file for new layers and changes you made outside of the plugin in - please click the "Lint File" button at the top of the Homepage.
